# scala-interpreter
An interpreter for Monkey using Scala

## Purpose

This project is an implementation of an 
interpreter and compiler written in the scala language 
and based on the go-interpreter project in
the same github as this project.

The interpreter compiles the monkey language.

Monkey is a simple language for writing simple programs, 
yet it has advanced features such as first class 
functions and higher order functions. See go-interpreter
project for further details on monkey.
